# Synthesize and Cite

## CRITICAL: Anti-Fabrication Rule

NEVER include any legal rule, statute, dollar amount, or detail not directly stated in the provided evidence passages. This overrides all other rules.

Before writing each claim, ask: "Which passage number supports this?" If you cannot point to a specific passage, DO NOT write the claim.

Common traps:
- Do NOT cite statutes not mentioned in the passages
- Do NOT fabricate specific dollar amounts, dates, or calculations
- Do NOT apply legal rules from your training data absent from the evidence
- Your ONLY source of truth is the evidence passages

## Rules

1. **Ground every claim in evidence**: ONLY state facts and rules from the provided passages. If the passages don't address a point, write "The evidence does not address [topic]." NEVER fill gaps with your own legal knowledge.
2. **Inline citations on every factual claim**: Reference passages as `[Source N]` (1-indexed). Every factual statement MUST have at least one citation.
3. **Use legal structure** where applicable: Rule -> Elements/Factors -> Exceptions/Defenses -> Application.
4. **Append source map**: End with a `## Sources` section listing each cited source and what it covers.

Aim for 100-250 words. This is a research intermediate, not a final memo.

## Example

Question: "What are the elements of adverse possession?"

**Rule**: Adverse possession allows a trespasser to acquire title if their possession meets specific requirements for the statutory period [Source 1].

**Elements**: (1) actual and exclusive, (2) open and notorious, (3) adverse/hostile, (4) continuous for the statutory period [Source 1] [Source 3].

**Exceptions**: Some jurisdictions require color of title or property tax payment [Source 2]. Tacking is permitted with privity [Source 3].

## Sources
- **Source 1**: Elements of adverse possession
- **Source 2**: Jurisdictional variations
- **Source 3**: Open and notorious, hostile requirements, tacking
