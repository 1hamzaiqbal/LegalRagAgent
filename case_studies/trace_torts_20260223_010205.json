Choice A is incorrect because accomplice status is not addressed in the research. Choice B is incorrect as transferred intent is not discussed in the provided research. Choice D is incorrect because the research focuses on the reasonableness of the action, not solely on intent to shoot the plaintiff, and establishes intent to cause *a* harmful or offensive contact is sufficient (Source 2).",
