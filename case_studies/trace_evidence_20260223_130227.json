While a newspaper *could* be self-authenticating, the question doesn\u2019t state it meets any of those criteria (e.g., published in a city with a circulation of over 25,000). It\u2019s least likely to be admitted *without a supporting witness* to verify its origin.\n\n(B) In a case involving contaminated food, a can label purporting to identify the canner as Defendant Company. \u2013 Can labels are often considered business records and can be authenticated through testimony establishing the regular course of business and the record\u2019s creation.\n\n(C) In a defamation case, a document purporting to be a memorandum from the Defendant Company president to \"All Personnel,\" printed on Defendant's letterhead. \u2013 The letterhead and internal nature of the memo suggest it\u2019s a business record, and likely admissible with minimal testimony establishing its creation and purpose.\n\n(D) In a case involving injury to a pedestrian, a pamphlet on stopping distances issued by the State Highway Department. \u2013 This falls under the public records exception to hearsay. Public records are generally admissible with proper authentication, which can be achieved without a witness if it bears the appropriate seals or markings.",
