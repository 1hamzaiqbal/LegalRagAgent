Even if true, it doesn\u2019t address the elements of battery itself. The core issue is whether Guard\u2019s actions constitute battery, regardless of Plaintiff\u2019s potential involvement with Robber. Missing element: addresses a fact not in the question, doesn\u2019t analyze battery elements.\n**(B) Yes, under the doctrine of transferred intent.** Transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to harm one person but harms another. While the initial intent was directed at Robber, the research does not state transferred intent applies to ricochet situations. More importantly, the question asks if Plaintiff will *prevail* on a battery claim, and transferred intent doesn\u2019t negate a self-defense claim. Missing element: fails to address self-defense.\n**(C) No, if Guard fired reasonably in his own defense.** This choice correctly identifies a potential defense to battery: self-defense. The research states deadly force is justifiable if a reasonable belief exists that it\u2019s necessary to protect against death or serious bodily injury. If Guard reasonably believed his life was in danger during the bank holdup and his response was reasonable under the circumstances, he would have a valid defense. All elements of battery are potentially negated by a reasonable self-defense claim.\n**(D) No, if Guard did not intend to shoot Plaintiff.** While intent is an element of battery, the research states the defendant need only intend to cause a harmful or offensive contact, not necessarily to injure a specific person. Guard intended to fire at Robber, and a harmful or offensive contact resulting from that action satisfies the intent element, even if Plaintiff was unintentionally struck. Missing element: misinterprets the intent requirement for battery.",
