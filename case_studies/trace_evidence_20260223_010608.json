      "reasoning": "The answer choices all involve documents that could potentially be self-authenticating or fall under a hearsay exception (like public records). However, option (A), a newspaper, is the least likely to be automatically admissible without a witness to verify its publication and authenticity. While newspapers can be admitted, they require more foundational support than, for example, a certified public record. The passages support the need for authentication and the potential for self-authentication of certain documents, but emphasize that newspapers would likely require more than just the document itself."
