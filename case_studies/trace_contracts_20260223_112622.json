Element 1 (offer and acceptance) is missing. There's no offer by the county, and Algernon\u2019s payment isn\u2019t acceptance of an offer, but rather an attempt to fulfill an existing (though mistaken) obligation.\n**(B)** Meddick treating Ryder while unconscious doesn\u2019t meet the \u201cintentional conduct\u201d requirement. Element 2 (acceptance through conduct) is missing because Ryder had no knowledge or consent, so no conduct could manifest assent. It\u2019s more akin to emergency medical care, potentially giving rise to a quasi-contract claim, but not an implied-in-fact contract.\n**(C)** Asphalt paving Nabor\u2019s driveway while Nabor watches and doesn\u2019t object strongly suggests an implied-in-fact contract. Asphalt offered to pave *a* driveway (Element 1 - offer). Nabor\u2019s silence and lack of objection, while watching the work, constitutes acceptance by conduct (Element 2 - acceptance through conduct/silently accepting benefits). A reasonable person would infer from Nabor\u2019s inaction that he assented to the paving and the implied promise to pay for it (Element 3 - mutual manifestation of assent).\n**(D)** Iris filing her mother\u2019s taxes is a familial act, not a contractual one. While there\u2019s an offer (Iris\u2019s service) and acceptance (mother\u2019s request), it lacks the intent to create legal relations necessary for a contract. It\u2019s a gift or family favor, not a bargain seeking enforcement. Element 4 (intent to be bound) is missing.",
