She knew the property was obtained in a manner constituting a criminal offense (theft) at the time of receipt. However, the seller is an undercover police agent. This fact could negate Morrow\u2019s intent to permanently deprive the owner of their interest, as the \u201cowner\u201d is effectively law enforcement.\n**(B)** Similar to (A), Morrow was told the car was stolen before the purchase, satisfying the knowledge element. However, Eames\u2019 involvement as an undercover agent complicates the intent element, as the theft may not be considered a completed criminal offense.\n**(C)** Again, Morrow was told the car was stolen before the purchase, satisfying the knowledge element. However, Cooper\u2019s cooperation with the police after the theft, and his intent to complete the sale, could negate Morrow\u2019s intent to permanently deprive the owner.\n**(D)** Morrow was told the car was stolen before the purchase, satisfying the knowledge element. Dixon\u2019s fraudulent insurance claim doesn\u2019t change the fact that he initially *stole* the car (even if he technically owned it). Morrow\u2019s knowledge that the car was stolen at the time of receipt, combined with the intent to permanently deprive the true owner, satisfies all elements of the crime without any apparent defense.",
