While accomplice status *could* be relevant to other claims, it doesn\u2019t address the battery claim itself. The elements of battery \u2013 act, intent, causation, and lack of consent \u2013 are not addressed. Missing elements: intent, causation, unreasonable force.\n**(B) Yes, under the doctrine of transferred intent.** Transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to harm one person but harms another. While Guard intended to harm Robber, the question doesn\u2019t state Guard *intended* to cause harmful or offensive contact with *anyone*. The ricochet was an unintended consequence. Missing element: intent to cause contact with Plaintiff.\n**(C) No, if Guard fired reasonably in his own defense.** This choice correctly identifies the defensive privilege of self-defense. The research states deadly force is justifiable if a reasonable belief exists that it\u2019s necessary to protect against death or serious bodily injury. If Guard\u2019s belief was reasonable under the circumstances (a bank holdup with a gun being fired at him), his actions would be justified, negating battery liability. All elements of battery are potentially met (act, intent to contact Robber, causation), but the self-defense privilege applies.\n**(D) No, if Guard did not intend to shoot Plaintiff.** While true that Guard didn\u2019t *intend* to shoot Plaintiff, intent for battery only requires intent to cause *some* harmful or offensive contact. Guard intended to shoot Robber, which satisfies the intent element for battery *unless* a privilege or defense applies. This choice doesn\u2019t address the self-defense justification. Missing element: consideration of self-defense privilege.",
