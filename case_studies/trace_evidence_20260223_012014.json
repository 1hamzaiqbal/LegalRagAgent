The document itself doesn\u2019t fall into a self-authenticating category (like a public record with certification) and there\u2019s no indication of a witness to verify its authenticity. Therefore, it is least likely to be admitted without a supporting witness.\n\n**(B)** A can label identifying the canner as Defendant Company is likely admissible as a business record or potentially self-authenticating due to its nature as identifying a product and manufacturer. No witness is explicitly *required* to authenticate it, as it\u2019s a label directly associated with the product.\n\n**(C)** A memorandum from the Defendant Company president on company letterhead is likely admissible. The letterhead and internal nature of the document suggest authenticity and reliability, potentially falling under a business record exception to hearsay. It\u2019s less likely to be challenged than a newspaper, and a witness may not be strictly necessary.\n\n**(D)** A pamphlet on stopping distances issued by the State Highway Department is a public document. Public documents are often self-authenticating or easily authenticated with minimal testimony, especially if they bear official seals or markings. It\u2019s highly likely to be admitted without a supporting witness due to its source.",

The passages detail these exceptions and the requirements for admitting such documents. Therefore, none of the options are *least* likely to be admitted without a supporting witness, and the question is flawed. However, the answer does not contradict any of the provided evidence."
