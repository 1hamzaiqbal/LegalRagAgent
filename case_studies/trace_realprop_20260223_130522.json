The remainder to Rem was not contingent; it was a vested remainder (to Rem, her heirs and assigns). A vested remainder is not subject to a reversion back to the grantor upon the remainderman\u2019s death. The element of a *contingent* remainder that never vests is missing.\n(B) Dan: This is correct. Rem received a vested remainder in fee simple, and a vested remainder is devisable. Rem devised her estate to Dan, thus Dan now holds title. All elements of a valid transfer of a vested remainder are met.\n(C) Hannah: This is incorrect. Hannah is Rem\u2019s heir, but Rem had a vested remainder that she could devise by will. Heirship is only relevant if Rem had died intestate (without a will), which is not the case here. The element of *intestacy* is missing.\n(D) either Owen or Hannah: This is incorrect. The remainder was vested, eliminating Owen\u2019s claim. Hannah\u2019s claim is also incorrect because Rem devised her estate to Dan. The element of a *contingent remainder* is missing, and the fact that Rem *did* have a will is ignored.",
