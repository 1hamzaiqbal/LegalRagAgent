Element 1 (offer and acceptance) is missing. There's no offer from the tax assessor to Algernon to pay Bathsheba\u2019s taxes.\n**(B)** Meddick treating Ryder while unconscious lacks assent from Ryder. Element 3 (mutual manifestation of assent/meeting of the minds) is missing. Ryder had no knowledge or consent, so there was no meeting of the minds. This situation may give rise to a claim in *quantum meruit*, but not an implied-in-fact contract.\n**(C)** Asphalt paving Nabor\u2019s driveway while Nabor watches and doesn\u2019t object demonstrates acceptance through conduct (Element 2). Asphalt reasonably believed Nabor would infer assent from this conduct (consideration from research). There is an offer to pave a driveway and acceptance by Nabor\u2019s silence and inaction, creating a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d (Element 3).\n**(D)** Iris filing her mother\u2019s taxes is a familial gesture, not a contractual offer and acceptance. While there's conduct, it lacks the intent to create a legally binding agreement. Element 1 (offer and acceptance) is missing; Iris wasn\u2019t responding to an offer, but fulfilling a request. There\u2019s no mutual manifestation of assent to a contract for services.",
