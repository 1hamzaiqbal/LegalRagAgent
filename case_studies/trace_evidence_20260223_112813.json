While a newspaper *could* fall under a business record exception, establishing that requires more than just presenting the newspaper itself. It requires demonstrating the newspaper\u2019s process for creating and publishing the content, and reliance on that process. Without testimony establishing these facts, it's unlikely to be admitted. It is not self-authenticating.\n\n(B) In a case involving contaminated food, a can label purporting to identify the canner as Defendant Company. - This *could* be admitted under the public records exception (if created by a government agency) or potentially as a business record if the proponent can show it was created in the normal course of business. It's more readily authenticated than a newspaper without a witness than (A).\n\n(C) In a defamation case, a document purporting to be a memorandum from the Defendant Company president to \"All Personnel,\" printed on Defendant's letterhead. - This is likely admissible as a business record. The letterhead and \"All Personnel\" designation suggest it was created and maintained in the ordinary course of the Defendant\u2019s business.\n\n(D) In a case involving injury to a pedestrian, a pamphlet on stopping distances issued by the State Highway Department. - This is most likely admissible as a public record. Documents issued by a state agency are generally considered reliable and fall under the public records exception to hearsay.",
