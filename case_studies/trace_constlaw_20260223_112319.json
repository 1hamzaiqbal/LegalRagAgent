The Senate appointing a commission to *finally* adjudicate a boundary dispute between two states is an exercise of judicial power, and effectively an appointment to a quasi-judicial position, without constitutional authorization. This exceeds the Senate\u2019s enumerated powers related to advice and consent on presidential appointments.\n\n(A) is proper: The Constitution outlines procedures for amending the Constitution, including ratification by states and a role for both the House and Senate in validating ratifications.\n(B) is proper: Determining the eligibility of a senator is within the Senate\u2019s purview as a body determining its own membership. This does not involve an appointment power.\n(D) is proper: Passing resolutions regarding foreign policy is a legislative act within the Senate\u2019s powers and does not relate to appointment powers.",
