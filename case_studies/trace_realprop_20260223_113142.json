A reversion only arises if the grantor retains a future interest. Here, the interest passes to Rem.\n**(B) Dan, because the vested remainder in Rem was transmitted by her will.** - This is correct. Rem had a vested remainder in fee simple. Vested remainders are transferable, and therefore Rem could devise her interest to Dan in her will. Dan takes Rem\u2019s interest.\n**(C) Hannah, because she is Rem's heir.** - This is incorrect. Because Rem had a vested remainder, it passes by will, not intestacy. Hannah would only take if Rem had died intestate, which is not the case here.\n**(D) either Owen or Hannah, depending upon whether the destructibility of contingent remainders is recognized in the applicable jurisdiction.** - This is incorrect.
