Element 1 (manifestation of assent) is missing. It\u2019s a unilateral mistake and doesn\u2019t demonstrate an offer and acceptance or conduct signifying agreement.\n**(B)** Meddick treating Ryder while unconscious doesn\u2019t meet the intent requirement (Element 3). Ryder had no knowledge or ability to consent, so there\u2019s no manifestation of assent by Ryder, and Meddick\u2019s conduct wasn\u2019t knowingly accepted by Ryder.\n**(C)** Asphalt paving Nabor\u2019s driveway while Nabor watches without objection *does* suggest an implied-in-fact contract. Asphalt\u2019s conduct (paving the driveway) is a manifestation of an offer of service (Element 1). Nabor\u2019s silence and lack of objection, while knowing Asphalt was paving *his* driveway, constitutes acceptance of the benefit (Element 2). Nabor reasonably could be seen as intending to accept the benefit, knowing Asphalt might infer assent (Element 3).\n**(D)** Iris filing her mother\u2019s taxes is a familial act, not a contractual one. While there\u2019s conduct (filing the form), it lacks the element of a bargained-for exchange or an offer accepted by the mother. It\u2019s a gift or favor, not a manifestation of mutual assent to a contract (Element 1 & 2 missing). There\u2019s no indication Iris expected compensation or that her mother intended to create a contractual obligation.",
