However, the seller is an undercover police agent. This fact doesn\u2019t negate Morrow\u2019s knowledge that the property was stolen, but it introduces a complexity regarding intent to deprive. It\u2019s unclear if Morrow intended to permanently deprive the *original* owner, or if she believed she was dealing with a criminal and the police would recover the car. Element 2 (knowing the property was obtained in a manner constituting a criminal offense) is met, but element 3 (intending to permanently deprive) is questionable.\n\n**(B)** Similar to (A), Morrow was told the car was stolen. The presence of an undercover agent assisting in the theft doesn\u2019t negate Morrow\u2019s knowledge. However, the agent *feigned* cooperation. This doesn\u2019t change the fact that Morrow knew the car was stolen. Element 2 is met, but element 3 is questionable for the same reason as (A).\n\n**(C)** Again, Morrow was told the car was stolen. Cooper\u2019s subsequent cooperation with the police doesn\u2019t negate Morrow\u2019s initial knowledge. However, Cooper was caught *as he was driving away* with the car, and then agreed to sell it to Morrow. This suggests Morrow may have believed she was simply purchasing a car from someone who had briefly possessed it unlawfully, and not necessarily intending to permanently deprive the original owner. Element 2 is met, but element 3 is questionable.\n\n**(D)** Morrow was explicitly told the car was stolen *before* the purchase. Dixon\u2019s fraudulent insurance claim and false reporting of the theft demonstrate the property was obtained through a criminal offense. Morrow\u2019s knowledge that the car was stolen, combined with the purchase, strongly suggests an intent to permanently deprive the original owner of their property. All three elements \u2013 possession of stolen property, knowledge of its stolen nature, and intent to permanently deprive \u2013 are satisfied. There are no facts suggesting a defense or exception applies.",
