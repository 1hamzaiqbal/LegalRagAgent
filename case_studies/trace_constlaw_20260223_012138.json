All elements are satisfied.\n(C) The Senate appointing a commission to *finally* adjudicate a boundary dispute between two states is constitutionally improper. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases involving a state as a party [Source 4]. By having a commission make a *final* adjudication, the Senate is improperly exercising judicial power, usurping the role of the Supreme Court. This violates the separation of powers.\n(D) The Senate passing a resolution calling on the President to pursue a certain foreign policy is an exercise of its power to influence foreign policy, which is within its enumerated powers.

The provided evidence details limitations on Congressional power, particularly regarding appointments (Passages 1, 3, 7), federalism and enumerated powers (Passages 2, 6), the Supreme Court's jurisdiction (Passage 4), investigative power (Passages 5, 9), delegation of power (Passage 10), and separation of powers (Passage 15). While the evidence doesn't explicitly state which action is *improper*, it provides the framework to understand potential constitutional issues. The question asks for what would be *constitutionally improper*, and the evidence supports evaluating each answer choice against constitutional principles. No contradictions or fabricated rules are present."
