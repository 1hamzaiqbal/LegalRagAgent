While a newspaper itself isn\u2019t necessarily hearsay, offering it to prove the *truth* of the libelous statements *within* the newspaper is hearsay. Authentication requires proof the defendant actually published it. The research states authentication generally requires testimony. While appearance/contents *can* be considered, a newspaper is easily fabricated, making authentication without testimony less certain.\n(B) In a case involving contaminated food, a can label purporting to identify the canner as Defendant Company. \u2013 A can label is likely self-authenticating or easily authenticated with minimal testimony. The label\u2019s appearance and contents strongly suggest it\u2019s what it claims to be.\n(C) In a defamation case, a document purporting to be a memorandum from the Defendant Company president to \"All Personnel,\" printed on Defendant's letterhead. \u2013 A company memo on letterhead is readily authenticated by its appearance and contents. It\u2019s highly likely a court would find it authentic with minimal supporting testimony.\n(D) In a case involving injury to a pedestrian, a pamphlet on stopping distances issued by the State Highway Department. \u2013 This pamphlet is likely a public record and potentially self-authenticating. Even if not self-authenticating, it\u2019s easily authenticated by its source (State Highway Department) and content, requiring minimal testimony.",

      "reasoning": "The question asks which item is *least* likely to be admitted without a supporting witness. All options involve documents offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., hearsay). The passages consistently emphasize the need for authentication, often through witness testimony. However, some documents are 'self-authenticating' or fall under exceptions like public records (requiring a custodian's certification). Option (D), the pamphlet from the State Highway Department, is most likely to be considered a published record and potentially self-authenticating or easily authenticated with minimal testimony. The others \u2013 a newspaper, can label, and company memo \u2013 are more reliant on establishing their origin and authenticity through a witness. Therefore, the answer correctly identifies the pamphlet as the least likely to require a witness."
