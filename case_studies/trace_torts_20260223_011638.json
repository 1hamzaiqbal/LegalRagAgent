While accomplice liability could be relevant in a criminal context, it doesn\u2019t negate battery liability if the elements are met. It also doesn\u2019t address the elements of battery itself. Missing element: analysis of battery elements.\n(B) Yes, under the doctrine of transferred intent. - Transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to harm one person but harms another. However, the research does not mention transferred intent as a relevant doctrine here. More importantly, the question states the guard *returned fire* \u2013 implying intent to harm the robber, not the plaintiff. Missing element: application of intent to the specific facts.\n(C) No, if Guard fired reasonably in his own defense. - This choice correctly identifies a potential defense. The research establishes that self-defense is a valid defense. If Guard\u2019s actions were reasonable under the circumstances (responding to a bank holdup with gunfire), he would not be liable for battery, even if the bullet ricocheted and injured Plaintiff. All elements of battery are potentially met (act, intent to defend, causation), but the defense negates liability.\n(D) No, if Guard did not intend to shoot Plaintiff. - While lack of intent to harm Plaintiff is relevant, it\u2019s not dispositive. The research states intent requires intending to cause *either* harmful or offensive contact. Guard intended to shoot Robber, and substantial certainty of contact with Robber existed. The ricochet is irrelevant to the initial intent. Missing element: proper application of the intent standard.",
