However, the seller is an undercover police agent. This fact introduces a significant complication. While Morrow knew the property was stolen, the source of that knowledge (an agent acting on behalf of law enforcement) could negate the element of \u201cobtained in a manner constituting a criminal offense by another person\u201d because Aster wasn\u2019t truly committing a crime by \u201cselling\u201d to Morrow.\n**(B)** Similar to (A), Ball told Morrow the car was stolen before the purchase. However, Eames\u2019 involvement as an undercover agent feigning cooperation complicates the \u201ccriminal offense by another person\u201d element. Eames\u2019 actions may break the chain of criminal activity.\n**(C)** Cooper told Morrow the car was stolen before the purchase. However, Cooper\u2019s cooperation with the police after being caught also complicates the \u201ccriminal offense by another person\u201d element. His agreement to sell the car could be seen as mitigating his criminal act.\n**(D)** Dixon explicitly told Morrow the car was stolen before the purchase. Dixon\u2019s fraudulent insurance claim and reporting the car stolen *are* criminal acts. Morrow knew the property was stolen (element 2) and by purchasing it, intended to deprive the true owner (likely the insurance company) of their interest (element 3). The facts satisfy all three elements without introducing a defense or exception.",
