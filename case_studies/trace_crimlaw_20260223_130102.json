While Morrow knew the car was stolen, Aster\u2019s status as an agent acting with police cooperation could potentially negate Morrow\u2019s intent to permanently deprive the *true* owner of the car, as the \u201ccriminal offense\u201d aspect is mitigated by police involvement. This creates doubt about element (2) and (3).\n**(B)** Similar to (A), Ball told Morrow the car was stolen, but Eames\u2019s involvement as an undercover agent complicates the \u201ccriminal offense\u201d element (2). Eames feigned cooperation, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Morrow knew a crime was being committed in the traditional sense.\n**(C)** Cooper told Morrow the car was stolen and was apprehended by police while selling it. This is similar to (A) and (B) \u2013 the police involvement complicates the \u201ccriminal offense\u201d element (2). Morrow\u2019s knowledge that the car was stolen doesn\u2019t automatically equate to knowledge that a completed criminal act occurred.\n**(D)** Dixon *told* Morrow the car was stolen, but Dixon actually owned the car and committed insurance fraud. Morrow knew the car was reported stolen, satisfying element (2) \u2013 knowing the property was obtained in a manner constituting a criminal offense (insurance fraud). Morrow\u2019s intent to permanently deprive the owner (Dixon, or the insurance company) is satisfied by the purchase. The presumption of good faith is rebutted because Morrow knew, or should have known, she wasn\u2019t the rightful owner. This choice most clearly establishes all three elements of receiving stolen property.",
