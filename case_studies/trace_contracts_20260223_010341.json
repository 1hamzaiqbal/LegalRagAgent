Choice B involves treatment without consent, more akin to an emergency exception or potential tort, not a contract. Choice D involves a familial act with no expectation of compensation, resembling a gift. Choice C most closely aligns with the research, as Asphalt paved Nabor\u2019s driveway while Nabor observed without objection, suggesting silent acceptance of offered benefits and a potential manifestation of assent through conduct, even if unintentional, which is a key element of an implied-in-fact contract as outlined in the provided research.",
