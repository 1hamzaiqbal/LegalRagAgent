The remainder to Rem was not contingent. Rem was an ascertainable person, and her taking was not subject to any condition precedent. Therefore, it was a vested remainder. Owen\u2019s reversion would only take effect if Rem\u2019s interest was extinguished.\n**(B) Dan, because the vested remainder in Rem was transmitted by her will.** This is correct. Rem had a vested remainder in Greenacre. Vested remainders are inheritable and pass through the remainderman\u2019s estate by will or intestacy. Rem devised her interest to Dan, and thus Dan now holds title. All elements of a vested remainder are met: Rem was ascertainable, and there was no condition precedent to her taking possession.\n**(C) Hannah, because she is Rem's heir.** This is incorrect. While Hannah is Rem\u2019s heir, a vested remainder passes by will or intestacy, not by inheritance. Rem\u2019s will controlled the disposition of her vested remainder.\n**(D) either Owen or Hannah, depending upon whether the destructibility of contingent remainders is recognized in the applicable jurisdiction.** This is incorrect. The remainder was *not* contingent, so the destructibility doctrine is irrelevant. The remainder vested in Rem, and passed to Dan via her will.",
