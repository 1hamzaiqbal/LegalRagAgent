Therefore, a Senate commission unilaterally adjudicating a boundary dispute between two states would improperly usurp judicial power reserved\u2014at least initially\u2014to the Supreme Court. Choice A is permissible as it involves joint action with the House regarding amendment ratification. Choice B is supported by the research regarding the Senate\u2019s advice and consent role in appointments (Source 3). Choice D is permissible as Congress can influence foreign policy through resolutions and appropriations (Source 1).",
