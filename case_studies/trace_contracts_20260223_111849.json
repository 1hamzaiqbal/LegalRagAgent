Element 1 (manifestation of assent) is missing. It\u2019s a unilateral mistake and doesn\u2019t suggest an offer/acceptance.\n**(B)** Meddick treating Ryder while unconscious lacks any manifestation of assent from Ryder. Element 1 (manifestation of assent) is missing, and Ryder didn\u2019t knowingly accept any benefits. This could potentially be a quasi-contract, but not an implied-in-fact contract.\n**(C)** Asphalt paving Nabor\u2019s driveway while Nabor watches and doesn\u2019t object *does* suggest an implied-in-fact contract. Element 1 (manifestation of assent) is met by Asphalt\u2019s conduct (paving the driveway) and Nabor\u2019s conduct (watching without objection \u2013 knowingly accepting a benefit). Element 2 (knowingly accepting offered benefits) is met. Element 3 (objective appearance of contractual intent) is met because a reasonable person would interpret Nabor\u2019s silence as acceptance. Element 4 (intent to engage in conduct and realize the other party may infer assent) is met by Asphalt\u2019s belief they had a contract and Nabor\u2019s awareness of the paving.\n**(D)** Iris filing her mother\u2019s taxes is a familial act, not a contractual one. While there\u2019s conduct, it lacks the objective appearance of a contractual intent. Element 3 (objective appearance of contractual intent) is missing. It\u2019s a gift, not a bargained-for exchange.",
